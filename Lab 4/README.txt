Map 2 Readme

The second map accomodates multiple zoom levels from level 7 to level 12
It uses the dst-atop compositing operation in order to ensure that the lines will always appear correct.
The main highways are shown in pink while other types will appear in blue.
The labels are applied to various highways depending on the length of the highway and the zoom level.
The lines in this file are styled so that the mainline highways will appear more visible than the others.

Map 3 Readme

The third map is a combination of the seattle coffee table extracted from the previous lab laid out on top of 
an OpenStreetMap layer of Washington state. The purpose of the roads layer is to give some context of where
the locations are.
